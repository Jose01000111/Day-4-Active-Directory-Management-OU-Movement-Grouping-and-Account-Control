# 🧪 Day 4 – Active Directory Management: OU Movement, Grouping, and Account Control

## 📋 Description
On Day 4 of the **Chicago Bank Branch - Active Directory Lab**, we performed essential administrative tasks in Active Directory using the **GUI tools**. This included moving users between OUs, creating security groups, adding users to those groups, and managing account statuses (disabling users). These exercises are crucial for mastering daily tasks as an Active Directory administrator.

## 🔹 Step 1: Move User Between Organizational Units (OUs)
### I relocated **Chris Young** from the `Employees` OU to the `HelpDesk` OU to simulate a department transfer. This helps reinforce OU navigation and organizational structure changes.

## 🔹 Step 2: Create a Security Group – ChicagoHR
### I created a new security group called **ChicagoHR** within the `ChicagoBranch` OU. Security groups are used for organizing users and managing permissions at scale.

## 🔹 Step 3: Add User to Group – Lisa Chen ➡️ ChicagoHR
### I added **Lisa Chen** to the newly created **ChicagoHR** group. This prepares her account for any group-based policy or access control assignments in the future.

## 🔹 Step 4: Disable a User Account – Omar Brown
### I disabled **Omar Brown's** account to simulate an employee departure or security lockdown. Disabling accounts (instead of deleting them) is a safe best practice.

## ✅  Summary
### Today’s tasks demonstrated how to manage Active Directory users beyond creation — including movement across OUs, group membership management, and account control. These are common responsibilities for Help Desk Technicians, System Administrators, and Active Directory Engineers. Mastery of these tasks builds the foundation for efficient identity and access management in enterprise environments.
